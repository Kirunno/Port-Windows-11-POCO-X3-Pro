## Booting to TWRP

- Reboot your device into TWRP, assuming you have installed it previously

Your POCO X3 Pro will boot into TWRP.

## Entering Mass Storage Mode

- Run the mass storage shell script in order to boot into Mass Storage from TWRP. You must decrypt your data if it asks you to.

```batch
adb shell msc
```

- If it asks you to run it once again, do so

Your POCO X3 Pro should now be in USB Mass Storage Mode.

## Updating Drivers

> [!WARNING]
> From now on we will assume X: is the Windows partition for all commands. Replace them correctly with what you previously picked or you will lose data on your PC.

- Download the latest driver package from https://github.com/woa-vayu/POCOX3Pro-Releases/releases/latest

Note: Here's a table of what to download if you're a bit lost:

| File Name                                       | Target Device         |
|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| POCOX3Pro-Drivers-v2XXX.XX-Desktop.7z           | POCO X3 Pro           |

- Extract the driver package, and go to the folder where you extracted it.

- Double click the ```OfflineUpdater.cmd``` file.

- Accept the User Account Control warning when prompted

- If asked enter the drive letter of the connected phone in mass storage, as we previously mentioned, for us it's currently ```X:```, but it may very well be different for you. In our example, we enter ```X:``` and then press enter.

- The process may take a while, once it is done, you will be prompted to press any key, press enter when that's the case.

Congratulations, you just updated your drivers!

- You can now reboot your phone using:

```batch
adb reboot bootloader
```

You will be put into POCO X3 Pro's bootloader.

## Updating UEFI

Simply use the latest UEFI image

- Assuming you are in POCO X3 Pro's bootloader, run the following command to boot into Windows:

```batch
fastboot boot uefi.img
```

### For Dual Boot installations, follow the [Dual Boot](/InstallWindows-en/DualBoot.md) guide again.
