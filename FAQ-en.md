# FAQ

## Can I update Android if I have installed Windows?

Yes! Feel free to do so. All Android updates until now have worked fine even if Windows was installed.

## Will you look into getting this device more mainlined (for linux) in the future?

Maybe.

## I would like to help, how can I reach you?

We'll be happy to talk to you on our [telegram channel](https://t.me/winonvayualt), note, you can help us with more than driver work, a lot of work is needed as well with documentation, support for the community, testing, developping apps, making a better shell, etc. We welcome any kind of help.
